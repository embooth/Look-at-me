        <h3 class="title"> What is Look At Me? </h3>
        <p class="about-me-text"> Look At Me is an online collective of creatives, we both create and collaborate. Now with more than enough content to consume online, it can be hard to sift your way through the shit. We wanted to create a site that features content that we want to read, watch and listen to ourselves; and we want that for you too! We want to give young emerging creatives (or just people who feel passionate about something and want somewhere to say it) the platform to display their work.</p>
        <h3 class="title"> What is different about us? </h3>
        <p class="about-me-text"> Not just any old blog! Whilst there is a place for one off content. Look At Me collaborates with other collectives, movements or individuals that are doing something really cool. These kinds of collaborations come in the form of Releases; we cover all elements of Look At Me (Read Me, Hear Me, Watch Me) with one subject in mind, much like a magazine release… expect you can’t listen to, or watch a magazine… So obviously this is infinitely better! </p>
